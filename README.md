# Express API Project

The task was to creat a simple API that would return data from a local file

## The problem

I created two separate end points. One that retuns a list of all the books and another that return a info about a specific book based on ID.

## View it live

I created a simple frontend, I used the opportunity to refresh my knowldege about Redux store setup, BrowserRouter and REdux thunks.
The front end can be found here: https://listofsomebooks.netlify.app/
The sever was deployed on Horoku and the main end point is:
